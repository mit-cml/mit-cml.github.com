         We have renamed the App Inventor Debug App to be the "App
         Inventor Companion." It also has a new logo, an Android with
         a WiFi symbol on his belly!  We will be updating the software
         on this server sometime early next week. You will need the
         updated Companion App in order to use the newer software.
       <p>
         You can download the new app here or from the Play Store. If
         you originally obtained the Debug App from the Play Store and
         checked "Automatic Update" you should have already received
         the new version or will shortly.
       <p>
         You can also download it directly <a href="AppInventorCompanion.apk">AppInventorCompanion.apk</a>.

         We have released a new version of the MIT App Inventor Debug
         App. This version no longer expires. However
         it <strong>is</strong> tied to the version of the MIT App
         Inventor Server it was built for. Therefore it will stop
         working when we upgrade the server. To avoid problems, we
         will announce ahead of time when we will be doing updates and
         we will have the new version of the MIT App Inventor Debug
         App available for download both on the server and in the Play
         Store ahead of the update. The new version of the App will
         work with the current server so you can upgrade as soon as we
         put up the new version.
         </p>
       <p>
         If you download the App from the Google Play Store, we
         recommend that you check the "Allow automatic updates" option
         on the installation screen.  You will then always have the
         most up-to-date version of the application provided your
         phone has an Internet connection periodically.

         <b>This version changes the way you connect to your
         phone.</b> The "Connect Wireless" button is gone. Instead
         under the connect menu there is now a "WiFi" option which
         does the same thing. Plus, if you exit the Debugger App you
         can start a new one and connect to the same blocks editor
         (previously you had to quit and restart the blocks
         editor). Just start a new debugger app on your phone. The
         newest version has a "Restart" button. Select "Restart" on
         your phone and then reselect "WiFi" from the blocks editor
         connect menu. It should reconnect without you having to enter
         a new code or scan a barcode.
       </p>
       <p>
         This version of App Inventor has new features that will be
         released on the main production server soon. In the meantime
         you may have problems downloading projects from here and then
         uploading them to beta.appinventor.mit.edu because your
         blocks will be too new! This problem should resolve itself in
         a few days when release v129 is out.
