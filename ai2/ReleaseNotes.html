                        <p>Changes in MIT App Inventor 2 are
                            documented on this page. Note: Versions that
                            end with a letter (for example: nb117c) are
                            bugfix releases.</p>
                        <h2>Changes between nb174 and nb173 (January 6, 2019)</h2>
                        <p>Note: This is a Component Release. Use MIT AI2 Companion version
                            2.50.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fixed an issue that prevented loading of pre-existing
                                projects containing a Map component</li>
                            <li>Fixed an issue where the default BackgroundColor for a
                                Screen running on Android 2.x was black instead of
                                white</li>
                            <li>Fixed a bug in the backpack that would prevent it from
                                opening if it contained blocks related from an
                                extension but the project didn't contain the extension</li>
                            <li>Fixed a bug in the new connection mechanism that would
                                prevent large projects (e.g., with maps) from
                                transferring to the companion</li>
                            <li>Fixed an issue where the AboutScreen textbox could be
                                made larger than the Properties panel (thanks to
                                @ethanhon for this patch)</li>
                            <li>Fixed an issue where the textbox labels in forms were
                                visually off-center (thanks to @ethanhon for this
                                patch)</li>
                            <li>Fixed a performance issue in the blocks connection
                                database that would result in long switch times to the
                                blocks editor in larger projects</li>
                            <li>Added two context menu item to show and hide comment
                                bubbles (thanks to @conorshipp of Kodular for this
                                patch)</li>
                            <li>Added bitwise and, or, and xor operators to the math

                            This is a bugfix release.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fixed an issue where the backpack icon would not
                                accurately reflect the backpack state when switching screens</li>
                            <li>Fixed an issue where components that require dangerous
                                permissions on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and later would
                                not work correctly on Android earlier than 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                            <li>Fixed a regression in File.ReadFrom that
                                broke the use of asset paths (i.e., //asset) in the Companion</li>

                        <h3>Major changes:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added a new communication protocol for the MIT AI2 Companion that
                                should be more versatile to different networks and firewalls. If you
                                experience difficulties connecting, you can use the old behavior by
                                enabling the "Use Legacy Connection" option in the companion</li>

                            <li>Update for Android 8.0 Oreo (SDK 26). This includes many fixes to
                                account for behavior changes in Android since our previous target,
                                Android 2.1.</li>

                            <li>Added three new blocks to Screen to handle user interaction with the
                                Android 6.0+ permissions model.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>AskForPermission: You can ask for permission explicitly by calling
                                        this method. Generally, components will handle asking permissions by
                                        themselves, so no change is necessary for existing apps to work.</li>

                                    <li>PermissionGranted: The PermissionGranted event will be run if the app
                                        user grants permission in response to an AskForPermission call.</li>

                                    <li>PermissionDenied: If a user denies a permission and you want to
                                        provide custom handling, you can drag in a Screen.PermissionDenied
                                        event block to ask again or disable any functionality that needed the
                                        permission.</li>
                                </ul></li>

                        <h3>Bug fixes:</h3>

                            <li><b>Blocks editor</b>: Fixed help URLs for some blocks</li>

                            <li><b>Button and related components</b>: Allow buttons on newer themes to be
                                smaller than the Android UI guidelines if they have an image set</li>

                            <li><b>Button and related components</b>: Fixed a bug where setting the
                                background color of a button to "None" would show the button as if the
                                background color were "Default" rather than removing the background
                                color</li>

                            <li><b>Material UI ripple effect</b>: Added support for ripple effect on button

                            <li><b>Designer</b>: Fixed a bug allowing  project templates to load even if the
                                project file contains a terminating newline</li>

                            <li><b>Designer</b>: Improved performance of loading projects with complicated
                                user interfaces</li>

                            <li><b>Maps component</b>: Fixed bugs in the GeoJSON support in Maps components</li>

                            <li><b>Tutorials</b>: Fixed a bug where large images linked from the tutorial
                                sidebar would take up the entire workspace, preventing any further
                                progress</li>

                            <li><b>Texting component</b>: Fixed a bug to allow SMS messages longer than 160
                                characters</li>

                            <li><b>WebViewer component</b>: Fixed a bug where setting the WebViewString from
                                blocks would trigger a WebViewStringChanged event</li>
                        </ul>

                            This is a non-component maintenance release. It re-engineers how the
                            buildservers (which package applications) are managed. In particular
                            you should no longer see the build progress bar go backwards (which was
                            a bug, now fixed).

                        <ul>
                            <li>Feature: Touch support for the designer and blocks editors.
                                App inventors can now create projects on a touch screen device,
                                such as a tablet.</li>
                            <li>Feature: Buttons with destructive actions (e.g., delete)
                                have a red background with white text to differentiate them from
                                non-destructive actions</li>
                            <li>Bug: NxtColorSensor was missing a default values, which resulted
                                in an error that prevented using the component. The default value
                                in the editor now matches the value specified in the companion.</li>
                            <li>Bug: Added missing documentation for File AfterFileSaved
                                event and addressed other minor typographical errors in the documentation.</li>
                            <li>Bug: Fixed a bug where extension icons would not appear in
                                the "Any Component" section of the blocks tree.</li>
                            <li>Bug: Fixed a bug where component names were not being translated

                            <li>Bug: Fixed an edge-case bug that involved an interaction
                                between loading multiple screens of of an out-of-date project
                                in the wrong order and the project upgrader. This would result
                                in a project structure that could not compile unless the project
                                was exported and then reimported back to App Inventor.</li>

                        <p>This is a component release, a new Companion (version 2.45) contains
                            the changes for this release. Older Companion Apps may work, but new
                            features will not work and other issues may be encountered. We
                            recommend updating to the latest Companion as soon as possible.
                            Companions downloaded from the Google App Store should auto-update.</p>
                        <p><strong>Starting with this release, MIT App Inventor
                            will require Android version 2.1 or higher.</strong>
                            We believe that there are only a very
                            small number of devices in use today that
                            have software older than this. Version 2.1
                            was released in 2009 and has been
                            unsupported by Google for several years.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Introducing the new <strong>Map component</strong> to
                                MIT App Inventor. This component, built on OpenStreetMaps, works on any
                                Android device. It includes a significant amount of new functionality
                                including customizability of seven new map-related components,
                                web-based editing of map content, and native support for distance
                                calculations (e.g., Haversine). More details are available at Evan’s Blog Post.</li>
                            <li>Introducing the new <strong>CloudDB component</strong>.
                                This experimental component provides a lot of the functionality of the
                                FirebaseDB component but without requiring a proprietary back-end
                                database. Like Firebase, MIT will supply a default storage back-end for
                                a reasonable usage. However MIT App Inventor programmers can choose to
                                operate their own back-end storage server using the open source Redis system</li>
                            <li>Adds support for <strong>App Themes</strong>, including
                                Material UI support, which let you specify the look and feel of user
                                interface elements such as buttons</li>
                            <li>Adds a color wheel to the designer
                                color property editor, permitting selection of colors from the full RGB
                                color space and control over opacity</li>
                            <li>Adds an <strong>“is-text?” block</strong> to test whether a value is a string</li>
                            <li>Implements a workaround for an Android issue that would cause the
                                Accelerometer to switch X and Y directions on some landscape mode
                                devices</li>
                            <li>Various updates to
                                facilitate the easier creation of extensions</li>
                            <li>Various bug fixes and performance improvements</li>

                            (or if it can even be done). This is
                            likely a temporary fix as using Google Voice
                            the way we are is not supported by Google,
                            and therefore may break in the future. We
                            are actively looking into an alternative
                            for non-phone devices (things like tablets
                            that do not have a phone number) to send
                            and receive messages.</li>

                            physical service, so no disruption should
                            be seen by anyone. However this change
                            will permit us in the future (with notice)
                            to move the service from Google to another

                            MIT. This will save us money (it costs to
                            host TinyWebDB for eveyone) and permit us

                            up a context menu with "Enable Workspace
                            Grid" option. This option is a user setting
                            and will persist across workspaces and
                            across App Inventor sessions.</li>
                          <li>Added workspace snapping. If the grid is
                            enabled, another menu option "Enable Snap to
                            Grid" will be available. Enabling this
                            option will make the top-left corner of
                            blocks snap to the nearest grid point. This
                            option is a user setting and will persist
                            across workspaces and across App Inventor

                          Note: This is a component release. The new Companion is version 2.38
                          available directly from MIT App Inventor or via the Google Play Store.
                          However if you do not use the Scrollable Horizontal and Vertical
                          arrangements, you can continue to use the old Companion (version
                          2.37). If you have a Companion older than version 2.37, you will be
                          prompted to auto-update your Companion.

                          <p>
                            Google has deprecated FusionTables version 1. It will stop working on
                            November 1, 2016. This update changes the FusionTablesControl
                            component to make use of the version 2 API. No changes to programs are
                            required. However packaged apps built with version nb149 or earlier
                            will stop working in November. Repackage apps with this version to use
                            version 2. If you distributed your Fusion Tables using applications,
                            either directly or through the Google Play Store, you need to
                            distribute a new version built with this version.
                          </p>
                          <li>Added Scrollable Horizontal and Vertical Arrangements</li>
                          <p>
                            We added two new Arrangements to provide scrolling versions of
                            Horizontal and Vertical arrangements.

                          <p>
                            Today we have dropdowns in the Designer for selecting alignment
                            values. However in the blocks you have to use numbers to represent the
                            different kinds of alignment. This change places those numbers in the
                            dropdown items as a convenience and reminder of those values.
                          </p>
                          <li>Add Comments to Block Save Images</li>
                          <p>
                            Fix a bug that causes images of blocks to not include any comments.
                          </p>
                          <li>Rewrite Extensions packaging scripts</li>
                          <p>
                            This change makes it a little easier for extension authors to build
                            extensions.
                          </p>
                          <li>Support upgrading of extension components</li>
                          <p>
                            You can now load a new version of an extension, provided it has the
                            same package name, over a previous version. Any incompatible block
                            changes between the old and new version will result in the blocks
                            being marked “bad”. The MIT App Inventor programmer then has to do
                            some cleanup, but this is way better then having to delete the old
                            component, which removes all associated blocks.

                          <p>
                            SelectionIndex() will now return the correct value even when a filter
                            is applied to the ListView.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            ActivityStarter will now generate an error if no intent “Action” is
                            provided.
                          </p>
                          <li>We now signal an error on Divide by Zero</li>

                            If you attempt to divide a number by zero we will generate an
                            error. This error can be caught by the MIT App Inventor Programmer
                            using the Screen.ErrorOccurred event. If it is not caught a
                            Notification is briefly displayed.

                            written by users in Java. Extensions are built using the App
                            Inventor sources and are packaged into &ldquo;.aix&rdquo; files.
                            &ldquo;.aix&rdquo; files can then be added to projects to add
                            functionality.</p>
                          <p>Limitations</p>
                          <p>Currently only non-visible
                            components may be added. Apps with extensions loaded may not be
                            uploaded to the App Inventor Gallery</p>

                              Component: This component is actually our first official release of
                              an MIT App Inventor supported extension. It is available for

                            <p>This extension supports a new protocol similar
                              to classic Bluetooth except that it is designed to consume less
                              power while maintaining comparable functionality. For this reason,
                              Bluetooth LE is the preferred choice of communication with IoT
                              (Internet of Things) devices that have limited power resources. We
                              are currently in the process of creating a new page on our website
                              that will provide documention, tutorials and other materials to
                              help use and understand the new possibilities that this new
                              component. A draft of this page can be found here:

                              component uses the accelerometer to determine the number of steps

                          <li>Add the new “Firebase” Component:<br/>
                            <p>This is an experimental prototype
                              release of the Firebase component.  Feel
                              free to use it for personal apps, but be
                              aware that the component is under active
                              development, and may change in a way
                              that could make your apps stop
                              working.</p>
                            <p>The Firebase component provides a
                              mechanism similar toTinyWebDB. However
                              it is hosted using a Firebase database
                              (<a href="http://firebase.com" target="_blank">firebase.com</a>) and supports updates to
                              variables from different copies of an
                              application, when multiple copies of an
                              application are running on different
                              devices which are connected to the
                              network. When one device updates a
                              variable the other will get a
                              “DataChanged” event with the new
                              value. This permits a form of “cloud
                              variable.”</p>
                            <p>The use of Firebase normally requires
                              an account at firebase.com, but by
                              default an account sponsored by MIT is
                              configured (via “branding” commits which
                              are not public) for the MIT sponsored
                              service.</p>

                            <li>Deprecated the “DoQuery” method in Fusion Tables. It has been obsolete since 2012. It will no longer be available from the blocks draw and any projects loaded which have a “DoQuery” method block will find that block disabled upon load, and highlighted with a red border to indicate that is a deprecated (and now not working) block.</li>
                            <li>Added a “Thumb Enabled” property to the Slider Component. This permits the slider to also be used as a “Progress Bar.”.</li>

                            <li>Added Italian translation to App Inventor, altered the language menu so instead of a “Ball” icon, it is now the name of the current language with a down “caret”. When selected this menu provides a list of supported languages.</li>
                            <li>Bugfix to “lookup in pairs” so that lookup keys treat numbers and their text representations in the same fashion.</li>
                            <li>Rational numbers are now always supplied as fractions. Prior to this change they may have been displayed as actual fractions (i.e., we will now display 0.11764 instead of 2/17).</li>
                            <li>Unicode can now be provided in an App Name.</li>

                        <p>
                          This is primarily a bugfix release. No new
                          Companion App is needed. However this
                          release deprecates the 2.23ai2zx1 Companion
                          in the Emulator. People running version
                          2.23ai2zx1 and earlier will be prompted to
                          auto-update their Companion. Although this
                          step can be skipped, we strongly recommend
                          performing the update. The current Companion
                          is version 2.24.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Bugfix to &ldquo;Typeblocks&rdquo;
                            (where you type in blocks instead of
                            pulling them from drawers). The
                            &ldquo;make a list&rdquo; block will now
                            contain two empty sockets when typed, the
                            same as when it is pulled from the drawer.
                            This same fix applies to several other
                            blocks that have mutators, for example,
                            the &ldquo;+&rdquo; block which used to
                            appear with no empty slots.</li>
                            <li>We have updated how MIT App Inventor
                              is cached and served. This should result
                              in slightly quicker startup over slow
                              network connections. It should also make
                              for a more rational experience for
                              people who are actively logged in when
                              we perform a release. (Note: The more
                              graceful transition may not be in effect
                              for this release, but should be for
                              future releases).</li>
                            <li>We are migrating some of our
                              documentation to Google Docs. In
                              particular this is so that people can
                              make comments and suggestions directly
                              onto our source documents. Pages that
                              have been updated will have a link near
                              the top that says: &ldquo;Click here for
                              a version of this page on which you can
                              comment.&rdquo; So far, only a few pages
                              have been migrated, but we plan to do
                              more.</li>
                            <li>We have resolved the issue where some
                              versions of Chrome on Windows did not
                              properly display Project Names as well
                              as some menu items and buttons.</li>

                        <h2>Changes between nb139 and nb140 (February 11, 2015)</h2>
                        <p><i>Companion Version to use:</i>&nbsp;<b>2.24</b>.</p>
                        <p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Added the “IgnoreSslError” property to
                            the WebViewer Component. This permits you to
                            fetch SSL protected content from sites
                            that have self signed certificates. Note:
                            This introduces a security concern when
                            used, as invalid certificates may be
                            accepted as well.</li>

                            <li>Added the “Deobsfucate Text”
                              block. This block lets you put a text
                              string into a packaged App that is
                              obscured from casual observation. This
                              may be useful for putting API keys and
                              other quasi-secret information into an
                              App. Note: This is not a fail safe
                              approach, as a determined interloper can
                              still extract the text, but it does
                              require some effort.</li>

                            <li>Cancelling a text input notifier will
                              now automatically hide the soft
                              keyboard</li>

                            <li>Added the Proximity Sensor component.</li>

                            <li>Padding was added around text labels
                            (the “HasMargins” property was added to
                            the label component). By default new
                            labels will have padding. Existing labels
                            in existing projects will not
                            automatically get this extra padding.</li>

                            <li>The BarcodeScanner component has had
                            the ZXing scanning code added to it. The
                            new property “UseExternalScanner” was
                            added. If true, the default, an external
                            scanning program is still used. However if
                            false, the internal scanner will be used
                            and an external program is no longer
                            required. Note: The internal scanner is
                            not as flexible as many external scanning
                            programs, be sure it works in your
                            situation before relying upon it.</li>

                            <li>Error handling in the
                              FusionTablesControl component was
                              improved. You can now catch Fusion
                              Tables errors and handle them in your
                              own code.</li>

                            <li>The “AppName” property was added to
                            Screen1. This property is used as the
                            Application Name for packaged Apps in the
                            Launcher. This means that the name
                            displayed on someone’s phone is no longer
                            tied to the project name and can have
                            spaces in it.</li>

                            <li>Text written onto a Canvas can now be
                            left, center or right aligned.</li>

                            <li>Fix a bug in the Spinner component
                            that would result in an extra
                            “AfterPicking” event being fired during
                            incremental development.</li>

                            <li>The ListPicker component can now have
                            its background and text color set.</li>

                            <li>The ListView component has a new
                            “TextSize” property which lets you adjust
                            the size of displayed text.</li>

                            <li>Added the “RequestFocus” method to
                            TextBoxes. When invoked the target textbox
                            will become the default location for
                            keyboard input.</li>

                            <li>The “ClearCaches” method was added to
                            the WebViewer component. When invoked any
                            cached content in the WebViewer is
                            discarded, ensuring that contact from the
                            server is fetched and loaded.</li>

                            <li>The Companion should now load changes
                            made in the designer faster. Changing
                            screens during development should be
                            faster as well.</li>

                            <li>Bugfixes and documentation
                            improvements as well as server
                            improvements that make it easier for us to
                            operate the MIT App Inventor service.</li>

                          </ul>

                            <li>Reverted the change to minSdk. The minSdk is now 3 again.
                              This change had caused some unexpected behavior to Balls,
                              Canvas and Sprites. We are working on resolving these problems
                              and will re-introduce this change when it is finished and
                              completely tested.</li>

                        <p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Updates and bugfixes to Date and Time Picker. You can now
                              set the time/date to be displayed when the Picker is opened.</li>
                            <li>Require an open project before permitting a Companion connection.
                              This avoids a confusion when new users, who have no projects, attempts
                              to start their session by connecting to the Companion when they have no
                              project.</li>
                            <li>The “About this Application” can now have line breaks in the displayed
                              message.</li>
                            <li>Screens are now not scrollable by default. You can still set the scrollable
                              property in the Designer.</li>
                            <li>Fixes to the Twitter Component: The Camera can now be used to take pictures
                              to be tweeted. We now send images directly to Twitter instead of Twitpic, which
                              is shutting down on September 25, 2014.</li>
                            <li>The Companion now has a “settings” page where you can set the location of
                              the “rendezvous” server. The rendezvous server is used by App Inventor to help
                              the Companion and the Browser find each other. By default the server at MIT is
                              used. This option permits local site operators to run their own server if the
                              network path to MIT is poor.</li>
                            <li>Add ability to configure the Companion connect QR Code to specify the rendezvous
                              server to use.</li>
                            <li>You can now export the current project as a “.aia” file while working on the
                              project. You no longer have to explicitly go the “My Projects” page and select
                              it.</li>
                            <li>Added Internationalization support to the App Inventor service. App Inventor
                              can now be translated into other languages. We have deployed Chinese with this
                              release.</li>
                            <li>The Fusion Tables component has been upgraded so you can provide “service”
                              credentials. Previously end-users had to authenticate to Google in order to
                              access certain tables. Now your App can authenticate to Google so end-users
                              don’t have to authenticate (or even have a Google Account). The old behavior
                              is still supported as well.</li>
                            <li>When you discard more then 3 blocks at a time into the trash can you will be
                              requested to confirm the deletion. This is to prevent accidental deletion of
                              blocks when you drag them over the trashcan (and you didn’t intend to
                              delete them).</li>
                            <li>Make sure the Runtime Error dialog box isn’t so large that it covers the
                              blocks area. This could happen if the error message to be displayed was exceedingly
                              long.</li>
                            <li>Provide a dialog box via (Help->Companion Information) where the most recent
                              Companion can be downloaded via a link and QR Code.</li>
                            <li>ListPicker will now close an open keyboard when an item is picked. The
                              keyboard might otherwise have been left open if the ListPicker filter bar
                              feature was used.</li>
                            <li>Update minSdk to 4. This deprecates the use of Android 1.5 (aka Cupcake) and
                              permits different screen sizes to be supported. This is particularly useful for
                              writing applications for tablets.</li>
                            <li>Bugfixes both to the code and documentation.</li>
                          </ul>

                            <li>Updated aimerger tool for AI2.  This is a tool that lets people merge screens from different projects to form a single project.  Documentation is at <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/resources/ai2-project-merger.html" target="_blank">http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/resources/ai2-project-merger.html</a>.</li>
                            <li>Add "Templates":  A feature where projects can be imported from a "repository" of projects. The initial version supports a currently small built in template (more projects to be added in the future) as well as importing your own templates.  See the link to “App Inventor Templates” at <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/library.html" target="_blank">http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/library.html</a>.</li>

                            <li>Changed clock component category from “User Interface” to “Sensors”.</li>
                            <li>Created a helper script to create new components (useful for AI developers).</li>
                            <li>Fixed TimePicker to show the current time by default when picker is opened.</li>

                            <li>Added new events to PhoneCall Component for reacting to incoming and outgoing phone calls.</li>

                          Companion (Version 2.18ai2zx1) which is necessary to do

                          To update the emulator, do a “Hard Reset”. Once you do this
                          the next time you start the emulator it will update its
                          internal copy of the Companion to the latest version.</p>

                            <li>Spinner: We added the “Spinner” component that lets you use an <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/spinner.html" target="_blank">Android Spinner</a></li>
                            <li>ListView: Added the ListView Component similar to the ListPicker, but runs in the current screen</li>
                            <li>TextToSpeech: Added a pitch and rate control.</li>
                            <li>Sharing: Added error handling</li>
                            <li>Added the “TimePicker” and “DatePicker” components to choose dates and times</li>
