 <title>New Version of the MIT App Inventor 2 Setup Tools for Macintosh</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2015/02/ne-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT App Inventor project has just released version 2.3.0 of the setup tools for App Inventor 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should use these new tools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new version adds additional flexibility, and fixes several issues that users have reported, and is now the standard MIT App Inventor 2 Mac Tools Installer.   Starting now, users who follow the getting started instructions for Macintosh will obtain the new version 2.3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new tools make few user-visible changes.  If App Inventor is currently working for you with Macintosh, you need not install the new version.  (Leave well enough alone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes for version 2.3.0:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed issue where where sometimes the first user installing setup tools had ownership over tools. Now all users are now able to run the tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated required Android SDK tools to the latest versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users should always make sure they have a backup of their data before installing any new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always please let us know if you find any issues or have any questions installing these new tools. By posting a message on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mitappinventortest&quot;&gt;MIT App Inventor Forum.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Version of the MIT App Inventor 2 Setup Tools for Windows</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2015/02/new</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT App Inventor project has just released version 2.3.0 of the setup tools for App Inventor 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should use these new tools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new version adds additional flexibility, and fixes several issues that users have reported, and is now the standard MIT App Inventor 2 Windows Tools Installer.   Starting now, users who follow the getting started instructions for Windows will obtain version 2.3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new tools make few user-visible changes.  If App Inventor is currently working for you with Windows, you need not install the new version.  (Leave well enough alone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes for version 2.3.0:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue caused when users selected a custom directory for installing the setup tools,, rather than the default.  Subsequently running the uninstaller would delete additional files. This should no longer happen with version 2.3.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that ins some cases would prevent the aiStarter program from launching the emulator or connecting to a device using the USB cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the ability to select whether to install tools as a single individual user, or for all users (the default). The installer will check and make sure you have the correct privileges to install accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can now install the setup tools using, Windows silent install mode.  This makes it more convenient for administrators to automate installations for classrooms or labs with many computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added improved error checking and user messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; Users who installed the previous version of the Windows setup tools v2.2 and earlier to a custom install directory &lt;strong&gt;must uninstall those tools manually&lt;/strong&gt;, by going to the custom location and deleting the “AppInventor” directory. At this point you can go ahead and run the new installer program following the directions specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users should always make sure they have a backup of their data before installing any new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general version 2.3 fixes bugs, allows for more control over installation and improves the user experience. As always please let us know if you find any issues or have any questions installing these new tools. By posting a message on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mitappinventortest&quot;&gt;MIT App Inventor Forum.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>App Inventor Goes Wireless!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2012/12/app-inventor-goes-wireless</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to be able to announce that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with today’s release of MIT App Inventor, v132, you no longer need a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.  We have added the option to connect the phone to the computer wirelessly.  Not only does this avoid the cable, it also eliminates the often tedious process (on Windows) of finding, downloading, and installing drivers specific to your device.  Now all you need now is a wireless (WiFi) network that your phone or device and your computer can both access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to use App Inventor wirelessly is to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion2&quot;&gt;MIT AICompanion&lt;/a&gt; from the Google Play Store. You start this App like any other Android App. The Blocks Editor now has a new “WiFI” choice in the “Connect to Device” menu. When you select that you will receive a six letter code which you enter into the MIT AICompanion to connect the phone to the PC. You are also shown a QR Code which you can use If your phone has a camera and a Bar Code Scanning Application. You can find more information and detailed documentation in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/setup-device-wifi&quot;&gt;wireless setup instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB option is still there, same as before.  But we expect that most App Inventor users will use the wireless method, which in general will be easier to set up and will give better performance. There may be some situations where wireless won’t work well -- such as when there’s no local wireless network, or the wireless network has poor performance. But we recommend that everyone start out by trying wireless to see if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are enthusiastic about this new feature, and we hope this makes your App Inventor experience easier and more productive. Please give us your feedback on the forums and report any problems or issues you may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H*app*y Inventing&lt;br /&gt;
The MIT App Inventor Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor Community Gallery from UMass-Lowell &amp; USF Seeks More Beta Testers </title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2012/10/app-inventor-community-gallery-umass-lowell-usf-seeks-more-beta-testers</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends and co-developers of the App Inventor Community Gallery have been hard at work and are seeking more &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/app-inventor-instructors/SO7Lbu-eOXs&quot;&gt;beta testers&lt;/a&gt; to load test, test the usability, and as importantly, to populate the Gallery with a range of interesting apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor Community Gallery is a site for sharing the code for apps you create, finding and learning from the apps built by others, and in general collaborating with other App Inventor developers. It is like Google Play, but all open source and all App Inventor apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gallery is currently in beta-release. It is being developed as a collaborative project involving UMass-Lowell, the University of San Francisco, and MIT. Its initial development was led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/&quot;&gt;Fred Martin&lt;/a&gt; and Derrell Lipman of UMass-Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USF, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://rock.usfca.edu/cs/wolber/&quot;&gt;David Wolber&lt;/a&gt;  and Vincent Zhang, is now leading the development in collaboration with Martin, Lipman and Paul Geromini of UMass-Lowell. The team is improving the site and gradually scaling it up for use by the thousands of App Inventor users, students, and educators. The goal is to open the site publicly by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Running your own App Inventor service</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/running-your-own-app-inventor-service</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, the Center for Mobile Learning is &lt;a href=&quot;/download-jar-files&quot;&gt;distributing Java Archive (JAR) files&lt;/a&gt; that let people run their own versions of App Inventor on Google App Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re still planning to deploy a public App Inventor service some time in the first quarter of 2012, to replace the service that Google will be turning off at the end of December. But we know that many people would like to use App Inventor during the transition period. To help with this, we will be distributing files that allow you to set up your own instance of App Inventor to support a small user community.  For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;University faculty might deploy an App Inventor service for students in their classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School IT departments might deploy an App Inventor service for students in the school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer hobbyists might deploy an App Inventor service for their private use or to share with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JAR files we are starting to distribute today are early prototypes that we are releasing for testing purposes: both testing for us, to identify bugs and other issues, and testing for you to determine whether running your own service would be appropriate during the transition period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these files requires knowledge of App Engine and the willingness/ability to support the load and costs of running AppEngine services.  Also, the code is still in an experimental state.  We can not guarantee that these files will be bug-free, but we have done enough testing of them to release them publicly, and we&#039;ll do what we can to address bugs and release updates in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve also created a discussion forum at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mit-appinventor-jars&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/mit-appinventor-jars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where people can share experiences with using these files, and -- especially important -- to report bugs that we need to deal with both for the JAR files and the public App Inventor service we&#039;re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the App Inventor JAR files and how to get them at&lt;/p&gt;
