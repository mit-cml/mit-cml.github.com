<strong>Welcome to the Preview of MIT App Inventor 2</strong>
<p>If you have a WiFi connection, a computer and an Android device, you can start building apps

apps, you do need to install an app, the App Inventor Companion, on your Android device.</p>

<p>Scan the following QR code to install the App Inventor Companion on your phone:</p>

<p>You can also download the companion to your device directly or to your computer, and then email it to yourself so
you can open it on your device.
